**What is version control?**
Version control is a system that manages and tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple poeple to collaborate on project while maintaining a history of all modifications. It records changes to file, such as code, documents, or configuration files, and stores them in a repository.
With version control, developers can revert to prebious versions, compare differences between versions, and understand the evolution of a project. It supports features like branching, where different lines of development can occur independently, and merging, which combines changes from different branches. Overall, version control ensures that changes are organized, recoverable, and easily managed, making it a critical tool in software development and collaborative projects.

**Why use version control?**
Using version control is essential for managing changes in software development, as it enables tracking of modifications, collaboration, and maintaining a history of your project. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's work, providing a clear record of who made changes and why. Version control systems facilitate rollback to previous versions if issues arise, and they support branching and merging, which are crucial for experimenting with new features and managing different stages of development. Overall, version control ensures code quality, accountability, and efficient collaboration in projects.
